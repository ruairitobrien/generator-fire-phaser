### Developing

Based on [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Phaser](http://phaser.io/). You will need node installed to continue.

Install required dependencies for the project in command prompt from the project directory with:

`npm install`

or if you use [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)

`yarn`

For all following commands, you can just replace `npm` with `yarn` if yarn is what you are using.

To build and run the application in a development server:

`npm start`

To package and optimize the JavaScript code for deploying to a web server:

`npm run build`
